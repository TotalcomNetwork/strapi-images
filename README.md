# Strapi Images

Images to run the Strapi CMS in a containerized environment.

## Quick reference

### Build the image:

```
 docker buildx build --push --tag artifacts.totalcom.it/library/strapi:[tagname-dir_name] --output type=image --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 ./[tagname-dir_name]
```

E.g.:

```
docker buildx build --push --tag artifacts.totalcom.it/library/nextjs:node-18.18 --output type=image --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 ./node-18.18
```

### Push image to Harbor

```
docker push artifacts.totalcom.it/library/strapi:tagname
```

E.g.:

```
docker push artifacts.totalcom.it/library/strapi:node-18.18
```

###  Build and push everything

Execute the `./build-and-push.sh` script to build and push all images to Harbor at once.

## How to use

Mount your app code in the `/app` dir inside the container using bind mounts; the `node_modules` and `.next` directories can be excluded, because they will be populated by the image in runtime.

For example, in a compose file add:

```yaml
volumes:
    - ./:/app
    # exclude the node_modules and .next directories with 'empty' mounts
    - /app/node_modules
    - /app/.next
```

By default the image will start a production server.
To start the application in dev mode, set the `ENV` var to `dev`.

For example, in a compose file add:

```yaml
environment:
    ENV: dev
```

> NOTE: When the container is launched, and no `package.json` file is found in the `/app` directory, the entrypoint script will trigger the creation of a new Strapi application with default configurations. Additionally, it will install the MySQL package as a project dependency.
